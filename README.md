## Labs Overview

### Lab1:

This lab provides a basic introduction to high-level synthesis using the Vivado HLS tool flow. You will use
Vivado HLS in GUI mode to create a project. You will simulate, synthesize, perfrom design analysis, and implement the provided
model.

### Lab2:

This lab introduces various techniques and directives which can be used in Vivado HLS to improve
design performance. The design under consideration accepts an image in a (custom) RGB format,
converts it to the Y’UV color space, applies a filter to the Y’UV image and converts it back to RGB.

### Lab3:

This lab introduces various techniques and directives which can be used in Vivado HLS to improve
design performance as well as area and resource utilization. The design under consideration performs
discrete cosine transformation (DCT) on an 8x8 block of data.

### Lab4:

This lab introduces a design flow to generate a IP-XACT adapter from a design using Vivado HLS and
using the generated IP-XACT adapter in a processor system using IP Integrator in Vivado.

**Note.** Since PYNQ-Z1 board does not have Audio CODEC chip, this lab cannot be ported/verfied on the board, though design flow is still applicable to the board.
